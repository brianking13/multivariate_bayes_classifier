# multivariate_bayes_classifier
A Multivariate_Bayes_Classifier to determine flower species based on sepal and pedal data.
A Naive Bayes Classifier was first built from scratch given the structure here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-classifier-scratch-python/
I then modified this code to implement a multivariate bayes classifier. The results are analyzed in the _Project Results_ PDF.
